JIT(Just In Time) compilation :- Use both interpretter & compiler.

Mark & Sweep Algorithm :- 

JS runtime environment contains all elements required to run JS.
It contains JS engine, set of APIs, callback queue, microtask queue, event loop.
JS engine is a piece of code.
Process includes :- Code --> Parsing --> Compilation --> Execution.
Parsing breaks code into tokens and converts it into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
Modern JS engine follows JIT compilation, It interprets while it optimises code as much as it can.
Execution & Compilation are done together.
Execution has garbage collector and other optimization such as inlining,copy elusion,inline catching etc.

*) Higher Order function :- Function that can take function as an parameter & can return a function;
*) Callback function :- Functions which are passed as an parameter to Higher Order function.

*) map method is used when we want transformation of whole array.
*) filter is used when we want to filter the array to obtain required value.
*) reduce is used when we want to reduce to array to single value.(e.g max,min,avg,sum,difference etc)
